        <p>Hi! My name is Isaac and I'm a Junior, going into my third year at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island!</a> I'm studying Film Media and minoring in Marine Affairs! I hope to one day be a well known filmmaker who can share my stories with everyone and entertain people with the films I create!</p>
