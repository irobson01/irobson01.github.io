        <h1>Welcome to <em>Isaac's</em> About Page</h1>
        <a href="index.html"><img src="pasted image 0.png"></a>
        <p>Hi! My name is Isaac and I'm a Junior, going into my third year at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island!</a> I'm studying Film Media but I'm also very interested in developing some basic computer science skills, hence why I'm taking this course.</p>
        <h3>My interests include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hanging out with my friends</li>
            <li>Being outdoors (for an activity or in general)</li>
            <li>Going to the gym</li>
            <li>Playing videogames (check out the ones I play at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198839796046"> my Steam page!</a>)</li>
        </ul>
       <p>If you ever see me on campus, feel free to say hello! I'm always wanting to meet knew people whenever I can! Here's what I look like just so that you know it's me!</p>
